# Final Project Retrospective

## Team Members
- Student 1: Nicholas Scott Campos
- Student 2: Virgil Ambrose Bombita

## 1. How did you divide the work between you and your partner?
_(Who worked on which features? How was the work assigned or negotiated?)_

The tasks were divided based on our strengths, and similarity of the tasks. We grouped related features to minimize switching and streamline the development process.
Scott handled the products, filtering of products by their attributes, and product creation and listing, since these tasks were related. While, Virgil worked on the user registration and login, and storefront and display.
We also discussed the task breakdown before starting the project and made adjustments for the code.

## 2. What Git strategies or commands helped you most during the project?
_(E.g., branching, rebasing, frequent commits, etc.)_

The commands that helped us the most during the project were git status, git branch, and git log. 
The commands git status and git log gave us the ability to check our edits on our local repositories before adding, and committing our changes to the repository. With these commands, we were able to frequently check the files that were edited as well as the commits that we have done in our repository.
The command git branch made sure that we were editing on the correct branches and not the main branch to refrain from constantly updating our local repositories with the changes that have been made by our collaborators.

## 3. Describe a merge conflict you encountered. What caused it and how did you resolve it?
_(Include any lessons learned or techniques used to resolve the issue.)_

We encountered a merge conflict when both of us made changes to the same section of the main.pseudo code, specifically with adding create_product and displaying products. 
The conflicts were resolved by communicating immediately to understand the changes that we made, what to keep and what to delete in the code. The codes were merged manually, making sure that both of our changes were preserved. 

## 4. What were the biggest challenges you faced as a team?
_(This can include communication, Git usage, or coordination.)_

The biggest challenge that we faced as a team was coordinating our codes to align with one another since we worked on different features of the application, which meant that we needed to consolidate and make the changes to ensure that we have a cohesive and working application.
To ensure that we were able to solve and bridge this gap, we constantly communicated and consulted with each other to ensure that we were on the right track in terms of building each feature and building the application as a whole.

## 5. What did you learn about using Git in a collaborative setting?
_(Any insights or habits you’d apply in future projects?)_

Working with Git in a collaborative setting taught me how communication, teamwork and version control is essential. Feature branches are important since they are isolated and reduce the risk of conflict compared to directly pushing in the main branch. Merge conflicts can occur but manageable through communicating effectively, reviewing the changes and resolving them with teamwork. Pull requests are essential since it helps us to check each other’s code, give feedback before merging and staying aligned with our goal.

## 6. How would you improve your workflow next time?
_(Think about technical habits and teamwork practices.)_

To improve our workflow next time, we will focus on better planning, clearer communication and using Git’s best practices. We should be using feature branches to isolate our own code changes. We should also make smaller commits which helps in tracking changes and rolling back the changes if there are issues. Instead of using merge, we can use pull requests to review the code and see the potential issues/ risks.

## 7. Optional: Any feedback on the activity?
_(What worked well? What was confusing or could be improved?)_

The activity of using Git and GitHub for our project made us more familiar with using these tools for collaborating as a team. Ensuring to create branches, using the staging area, and reviewing pull requests, to successfully finish the task at hand and making collaborating with each other easier than ever. This also showed us the potential and importance of Git and GitHub when working with other team members to produce a high quality product.
